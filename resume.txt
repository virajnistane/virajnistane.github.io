Work Experience
Data Engineer || Tough Tongue AI, Remote
05/2025 - Present
- Designed and operated advanced ETL routines, transforming semi-structured noSQL application data to reliable
analytical products in PostgreSQL, optimised for bulk data ingestion, throughput, and transformation e ciency
- Orchestrated and automated analytics work ows using Prefect/Cronitor (DAG-style scheduling, retries, alerts),
feeding up-to-date metrics into Marimo dashboards supporting product, nance, and operations decisions.
- Implemented testing, logging, and basic observability on pipelines, enabling faster incident detection and more
reliable, repeatable releases in a small, fast-moving team
- Delivered actionable insights on usage, retention, and system performance, directly supporting product strategy
and competitive performance, while enhancing user engagement
Research Software Engineer || Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur, Nice, France
10/2024 - Present
- Built and maintained a user-oriented data quality-control platform (EuclidClusterViz), streamlining development
as well as production data access and signi cantly boosting research turnarounds for scienti c users
- Developed modular data pipelines for robust, scalable, and compliant scienti c data ow, with documentation that
enabled self-service use across a diverse scienti c team
- Integrated CI/CD practices using GitLab and Jenkins, supporting modular development, automated testing, and
seamless deployments for complex, long-running data work ows
- Designed a exible Pipeline Processing Order (PPO) framework to orchestrate and optimize computation, ensuring
reliable, dependency-aware task execution across research work ows
Doctoral/Post-doctoral Researcher || Université de Genève, Geneva, Switzerland
08/2019 - 09/2024
- Led simulation-driven parameter forecasting studies in large-scale astronomical collaboration, framing outputs as
opportunity-evaluation analyses that compared various survey con gurations and quanti ed their impact on
scienti c yield under resource constraints
- Developed a robust Python package (HIRAXmcmc) enabling e cient Bayesian analysis and forecasting
- Engineered and validated an advanced statistical estimator to extract weak signals from noisy spatial density data,
boosting signal-to-noise by 30-38x through optimized variance reduction
- Co-developed SERENEt, a deep learning framework for recovering astrophysical signals from contaminated radio
images, including extracting and structuring training data from external GLEAM-MWA online catalogs into reliable
analytical datasets
